    <h2>A meetup for London JavaScript developers and designers</h2>

    <p>gin.js is <strong>an event for JavaScript people to meet and talk</strong>. Like <strong>the fun bit after an event, without anything beforehand</strong>. There are no presentations or set agendas.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="datelocation"></a>Next gin.js</h3>

    <p>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/ginjs_london">@ginjs_london</a> for the next announcement!</p>

    <h3><a name="rules"></a>Rules</h3>

    <p>You must be a person who can <strong>make things in JavaScript</strong> - i.e., a developer or designer. People learning are welcome too.</p>
    <p><strong>gin.js is a friendly environment for anyone who builds things with JavaScript</strong>. Please be respectful to other attendees, sponsors and organisers. If you feel uncomfortable with the behaviour of someone, let the organizers (usually the person who greeted you) know. We will take your concerns seriously. We have lovely attendees and have never had to do so, but we do reserve the right to politely ask people to leave if they act against the spirit of this code.</p>

    <h3><a name="sponsors"></a>Sponsors</h3>

    <p>gin.js attendees are some of London's (and the world's) best JavaScript programmers.</p>

    <p><strong>If you need additional frontend or node people</strong>, or other JS developers, sponsoring gin.js is an excellent (and cost-effective) way to get your message out directly to the development community. Many companies have have hired people based on connections made at gin.js. Your message doesn't just reach attendees but also their own contacts who are looking for roles.</p>

    <p><strong>If your company produces APIs or tools</strong> useful to frontend or node developers gin.js provides an excellent place to let people know about what you produce.</p>

    <p>We've been lucky to have some great sponsors in the past, <a href="https://twitter.com/mikemaccana">if you'd like to join them, contact Mike for details.</a></p>
