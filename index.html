    <h2>gin.js Oakland California - December 10 2014</h2>

    <p>The lovely people at <a href="http://oakland.jsfest.com/">JSFest Oakland</a> are running a gin.js as part of the JSFest week of festivities. See <a href="http://oakland.jsfest.com/">JSFest Oakland</a> site for details!</p>

    <h3><a name="rules"></a>For anyone who makes things with JavaScript</h3>

    <p>gin.js is for anyone who makes things with JavaScript - all developers and designers, including people learning to be developers and designers.</p>
    <p>Recruiters are not welcome.</p>
    <p><strong>Code of conduct</strong>: attendees must be respectful to other attendees, sponsors and organisers. If you feel uncomfortable with the behaviour of someone, let the organizers (usually the person who greeted you) know. We will take your concerns seriously. We have lovely attendees and have never had to do so, but we do reserve the right to politely ask people to leave if they act against the spirit of this code.</p>

    <h2><a name="organisers"></a>Organizers</h2>

    <p>gin.js is organised by <a href="https://twitter.com/mikemaccana">Mike MacCana</a>. If you'd like to get in touch, you can <a href="mailto:mike.maccana@gmail.com">email Mike</a>.</p>

    <h3>Sponsoring</h3>

    <p>If your company needs to reach developers directly - for recruiting, to show off your API, or any other reason - sponsoring gin.js is a proven and cost effective way to reach out not just attendees but to the whole London JavaScript community. </p><p>Sponsors are asked to note the code of conduct - we have a lot of sponsorship offers, and we like to pick companies that align with our own values. If that sounds like your company, please <a href="mailto:mike.maccana@gmail.com">get in touch</a>.</p>
